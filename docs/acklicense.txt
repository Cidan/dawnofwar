PROMPT <%*> where "<%*>" are the various variables you may set for yourself.
 
        %h :  Display your current hits.
        %H :  Display your maximum hits.
        %m :  Display your current mana.
        %M :  Display your maximum mana.
        %v :  Display your current moves.
        %V :  Display your maximum moves.
        %x :  Display your current experience points.
        %g :  Display your current total gold held.
        %a :  Display your current alignment.
        %r :  Display current room name.
        %R :  Display current room vnum  (IMMORTALs Only!).
        %z :  Display area name  (IMMORTALs Only!)

              the 2 letter class identifier used in the who output.
              EXAMPLE: %wMa will give exp still needed for your next mage level.
        %W :  same as above, but shows total exp needed for that class. 
        %! :  current hitroll
        %+ :  current damroll
        %* :  current ac
 
Example:  prompt <%hhp %mmn %vmv>
 
  Will give you a prompt that looks like "<10hp 10mn 10mv>"
  (Here, we assume 10 is what your character has..)
 
  You may ask around for the best prompt forms, as others may have found one that they like, or experiment on your own and see what works for you.  Remember, you can put color in your prompts.. make certain numbers stand out.
