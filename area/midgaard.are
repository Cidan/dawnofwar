Entering the {RSyringe{x~

man with unkempt hair and the smell of cheap wine on his breath appears, and

shouts: "Oh my, another victim to experiment on!!!  MUAHHAAAAA!!" He waves his

hands and mutters loudly, and suddenly, you begin to shrink!!! Smaller and

smaller you become, until you are smaller than the dust particles around you..


It seems the only way to go is DOWN.

mysterious messanger speaks of? And what does it mean to this desperate land?

The air feels light here, almost like if you're not breathing. The walls are a
beautiful dark deep chestnut color, and feels smooth to the touch. No doubt
the queen wanted the kingdom's Inn to feel appeasing to new comers.
