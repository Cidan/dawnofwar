{wLesson VII : COMBAT~
{xCOOL!! Now we get to kill some stuff! First, though, You need to realize
that as a young adventurer, You are not powerful enough to kill everything, so
we have given You a helpful command called {Gconsider{x.  You use this by
typing {Gcon {m<mob name>{x.  It will give You information on how powerful
the mob is in relation to your self. You should use this command anytime You
are not sure how powerful a mob is, so that You may judge your ability to
defeat it. Also, You need to keep in mind that some mobs are {caggressive{x,
meaning that they might attack you! To make sure that You can survive this,
You should rest periodically, to regenerate both hit points and mana.. If You
have not already, type {Gconfig +prompt{x, then type {Gprompt all{x.  This
will show You how healthy You are. Now, if You need to rest, You may rest or
sleep before going {GWEST{x to the Combat Hall!

Lesson V: Rules Part IV~
{xNow, while there are other rules in the game, we will not burden you with
them right now.  Basically, be polite and considerate of other players, and
you will not get into trouble. This applies double when you are talking or
dealing with ANY {mimmortal{x. We pride ourselves on ensuring that our
{mImmortal Team{x is the fairest and most honest of any mud you will find.
it is our goal to make this mud fun for all! However, there may be times when
{mimmortals{x ask or tell you to do something...do not argue, do not whine,
please just do it. If you feel that what they are doing or saying is unfair,
then you may politely suggest it to them. If they have the time, they will
explain the situation to you.  If they do NOT have the time, then please
accept their directives, and realize that we have immortal rules, too, and all
{mImmortals{x follow them to the letter. Finally, please realize that being
an {mimmortal{x is much more than just having godlike powers.. it carries a
huge amount of responsiblity, and {mImmortals{x are ALWAYS busy completing
tasks to make this mud a better place, maybe building a cool new area, coding
some really awesome stuff, or other immortal type stuff. If you have repeated
problems with a specific immortal, please ask to speak with a {BCreator{x,
and they will evaluate the situation, and give you their judgement.
Type {GSOUTH{x to continue :)

unless you have their permission.  This is called kill stealing, and is
considerd very rude.  Depending on the player you do it too, they might kill
you for the fun of it, or hire a {RMercenary{x Mob to hunt you down and
kill you!

wear items.  To do this, type {cWEAR{x [item].  There should be a pair
of X-Ray specs on the floor.  Just like in real life, they don't give you
X-Ray vision.  But, these will give you a little bit of armor, so you
should want them.  First, {cGET{x them.  Now, {cWEAR{x them.  This
is all there is to it.  You can use this for weapons, armor, wands, and
anything else that you can {cWEAR{x.  Continue WEST.

Lesson III: Communication~
{xThe basis of communication are things called {cCHANNELS{x.  Each channel
has a specific usage.  There is a channel for your race, one for your
clan (if you join one), and others.  Here I will tell you how to
toggle your channels, and in {xThe next room, you will learn what each
of {xThe channels is specifically meant for.
{xThe first thing you should do is {GCHAN +HERMIT{x.  This option will make
it so that your channels become active.  {GCHAN -HERMIT{x will turn all
of your channels off.  To toggle a channel, just {GCHAN +[channel]{x and
to turn it off, just {GCHAN -[channel]{x.  Now to learn {xThe channels, go
{GUP{x. (Note: To speak on a channel, type {xThe channel name followed by
your message.  Except for {xThe auction channel).

{Gconfig -[option]{x, to turn it off, or {Gconfig +[option]{x to turn it on.
For information on what the options are, type {GHELP{x {GCONFIG{x.
NOTE: {Gconfig +COLOUR, +AUTOEXIT, +COMBINE, and +PROMPT {xare very useful.

options are.  If you want a list of exits from a room, you can type
{GEXITS{x.  This shows you all VISIBLE directions you can go.  (Hidden exits
such as doors and secret passages, are not shown).  This is useful for
navigating the mud.  Also, if you do not wish to type exit in every room,
you can configure autoexit to the on setting, but that is the next lesson.

{xLesson I: {cMovement{x (part 2)~
{xVery good, student!  You are definatly catching on!  Keep this up, and
you will graduate in no time!  Part two of this lesson deals with how to
move without typing out the whole words.  Instead of typing {GNORTH{x to go
north, you may simply type N.  To go up, use U.  And so forth.  The
first letter of the direction will work, as well as using the whole word.
To continue, move {GNORTH{x (or {GN{x).

{xLesson I: {cMovement{x (part 4)~
{xHere is where you will learn about {cDOORS{x and {cLOCKS{x.  {cDOORS{x are simply
directions in which you can move, but are not available until you {GOPEN{x
the door first.  Monsters can't {GOPEN{x doors, and it is many an adventurer
that has been saved by closing a door on an angry monster.  To {GOPEN{x a door,
all you have to do is type {GOPEN{x followed by the direction in which the door
is located.  Example:  {GOPEN{x {GD{x will {GOPEN{x a door leading DOWN.  To {GCLOSE{x a
door that is OPEN, just type {GCLOSE{x followed by the direction in which the
door is located.  Example: {GCLOSE{x E will {GCLOSE{x the door to the EAST.
I really hope that you have been paying attention to this lesson.  Why?
Because, to leave this room, you have to get by the door that is {GUP{x to
continue.  If you don't, you will most likely starve.

a DOOR to the NORTH.  {xYou can try to {GOPEN{x it, but it it locked.
{xYou must have a KEY.  It just so happens, that there should be a {mKEY{x
on the floor in this room. (If not, wait a few minutes, there will be one soon
.  Type {GGET KEY{x, this will take the KEY{x, so {xYou can {GUNLOCK{x
the door.  Once {xYou have the KEY{x, type {GUNLOCK{x {GN{x to
{GUNLOCK{x the door to the north.  Now, {xYou can {GOPEN{x the door,

After all, it is all in Black and White...
Not anymore! In order to get {ccolour{x, you must first {Gconfig +COLOUR{x.
After that, type COLOUR to see what your current colours are set at.
This will also show you your available colours.  (Note, this MUD was
written with Brittish code, so it is spelled COLOUR instead of COLOR).
To learn how to change colors, type COLOUR{x.  When you finish changing
all of your colours, continue {Gnorth{x.

Prayer~
{xThis is your last lesson in communication.  It is called {cPrayer{x.  Praying
is useful for when you need assistance in a matter that no mortal can handle.
Such as getting stuck in an area with no escape, finding a bug, or just when
you have personal business with an {mIMM{x (or Immortal).  Immortals are the
backbone of the mud.  These are normal people, just like you, who have
special commands that allow them to create, change, and destroy anything
in the mud.  If you want to send a message to the Immortals, type:
{GPRAY{x [Message].  You can try it right now.  Just type:
{GPRAY{x I am new here, and learning how to use pray.
What happens from there depends on what immortals are online.  You might
get a few words of encouragement, you might get something special, you
might get scolded, or nothing at all.  Now you may continue {GNORTH{x to lesson
four.

Lesson IV: Items and Equipment~
{xIn this lesson, I will teach you how to use equipment and items.
First thing you need to know is {cGET{x. The {cGET{x command will take an
item off of the floor, and put it in your inventory.  You can try
that right now.  There should be a bag on the ground.  (If not, wait
for a fewmoments, and one will appear).  Type {cGET{x BAG.  This will
take the bag off of the floor, and you will have it in your inventory.
Once you have the bag, type {cINV{x (short for {cINVENTORY{x).  You should see
the bag.  Now type {cDROP{x BAG.  This takes the bag out of your inventory,
and puts it on the floor.  But, you want this bag, so {cGET{x BAG again, and
continue up.

you can learn a few other commands with items.  {cREMOVE{x is one important
command.  You can use it to stop using an item.  Try to {cREMOVE{x your
specs by typing {cREMOVE{x SPECS.  You should now have them in your inventory.
Now, to learn {cPUT{x.  This command is used for containers, like your
bag. Let's practice the {cPUT {Wcommand, {cPUT {Wyour specs into 
your bag, you do this by typing {cPUT {Wspecs bag. To get it 
or another item out of a container type {cGET {Wspecs bag, (Or
Whatever container you are using).

{xOkay, now for the no fun part.  We have certain {crules{x that all
mortals must follow in this mud.  Every rule has it's reason, and we expect
each and every one of you to follow them.  First and foremost, we demand that
there be no cussing swearing, or obscene acts or language on any public
channel.  While we don't like this rule, we are forced to follow it due to the
Internet Indecency Act, since our server is located in the United States. In
protest of this law, you will find a free gift from us..a Ribbon Proclaiming
Free Speech!  We ask that if you agree that this law violates your 1st
Amendment rights of free speech please e-mail or write your congressperson
expressing your views.  Thanks!!

not a good thing, since high level mobs will hunt you down and kill you! You
may ask an {mImmortal{x to become pkok when you are higher level, but

{xIn the next few rooms you will learn how to Fight Mobs, and as you kill mobs you will gain {Yexperience{x.  Gaining levels is {RNOT {xautomatic, once you get enough {Yexperience {xto gain a level, you must go to a {CTrainer {xand type {YGain {x<{Y3{x-{Yletter Class Abbreviation{x>.  Eg. {CGain Mag {x- will gain one level in Mage if you have enough {Yexperience{x.  
 
In {BS{do{RE {xwe have a Multi-Class System in which you may gain levels in each Class rather than choosing only One Class.  However in order to save your character, your {CPrimary Class {xmust be Level 2.
 
{xYou can type {CWORTH {xto see if you have attained enough {Yexperience {xfor your next level.  The {CWorth {xCommand displays a list of any classes you can level in as well as the {RCost {xin {Yexperience {xto gain in it, and the {RDifference {xbetween that {RCost {xand your {RCurrent {Yexperience{x.
 
{xThere are two {CTrainers {xnear Recall in {RMidgaard{x.  The First is from {YRecall{x Up, North, West.  Here you can {RGain {xlevels as well as {RTrain {xyour Attributes.
