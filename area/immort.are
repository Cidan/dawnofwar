Coder's Information Booth~
You are in a small, inter-dimensional room within the mud.

Looking around, it seems like other realities have broken through

the barriers surrounding the realms of SoE.  In one corner of the room

you are able to see strange particles of energy whizzing back and forth,

Maharet's Parlour.~
As soon as you walk into this room you notice the smell of a soft perfume,

reminding you of better days, but somehow tainted with a tang, of something

undiscernable. Then you suddenly notice what it is. The smell of death, the

smell of blood. But somehow, in this place, that taint seems enthralling,

holding a certain romance. You try to pretend that the large vial of blood on

the red marble table does not exist as you take in the comfy-looking plush

cushions in one corner of the room, and the massage table in the other (the

massage oil looks suspiciously red too). Looks like the favoured of Maharet

get good treatment here. The crowning glory to this room is the slave,

patiently waiting with a silver tray, willing to dispense or do anything his

great mistress commands. He has an unearthly look, even if he is outwardly

human. The eyes are pure gold, and stare into space. He moves with the grace

of a panther however, and will guard his deity of vampires for all eternity.

{YModel Home Bedroom{x~
{YYou sit down on the model home's bed, and wonder vaguely if they make

uncomfortable beds just for Model Home showings. A radio in the corner plays

Kenny G. music, and you wonder how many years in jail you'd get for killing

whoever set the station. A large mirror is on one wall, and you take a moment

to check yourself out. While the tacky decoration isn't exactly what you'd

want in a house, the layout is superb and, if you were in charge of decoration

and stuff, you know that this could be a magnificent house. Perhaps you should

buy one?{x

deep into this room, due to the amount of hazy smoke there is floating around.

The Entry Point serves as a gateway between the mortal and immortal realms.

This room is bare, except for the door leading off west.  When Immortals tire

of the mortal realms, they will often return to the Halls of the Immortals

through this room.  A large, swirling spindle of energy glows fiercely in the

exact centre of this room - looks like this is where an Immortal will appear!

The magical force preventing recall within the Halls feels weaker here.

The bright and cheery fireplace in the far wall lends a particularly warm

to the Master of the House's dislike for furniture.

A doorway stands in the north wall of this room.

Gates of Heaven~
Red fire spews everywhere. A huge, wicked looking gate door looms, with a
giant sign saying "Welcome to Eternal Damnation." The wicked giggling of
demons and devils can be heard, and the screams of tortured souls echo
everywhere. Yes, Saint Peter likes to have a bit too much fun with the
incoming souls. He just loves to scare the hell outta them by making them
think they're going to hell. What a lamer.

You are in a small room, completely encapsulated, away from all the troubles

of the realms of Ack.  You notice that the walls and floor are constructed

from finest marble.  Large, soft benches line the walls, providing ample

seating for the many mortal builders who are allowed to visit this room. It

seems as if this room's sole purpose is to allow the Immortals of these realms

to leave messages and guidelines for their mortals to take notice of.

This plain, simple room is constructed from a strange, see-through material,

which allows you to see the strange landscape beyond.  Eerie clouds of pure

energy wash around the room,  causing it to gently rock back and forth.

To the East, a glowing portal leads to the Temple of Midgaard.

rooms behind it.  Below you, you can see the thinking room.

There is no life, truth, intelligence nor substance in matter. All is

 infinite mind and its infinite manifestation, for God is all in all, Sprit

in immortal truth: matter is mortal error.  Spirit is the real and eternal;

matter is the unreal and temporal. Spirit is God and man is His image and

likeness.  Therefore man is not material, he is spiritual.
