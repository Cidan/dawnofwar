0 cybertown~
{YCybertown{w is a VERY cool website!  Go check it out at:





	http://www.cybertown.com




Cybertown is a virtual city, online, built through the use of multiple 




webpages.  It really is well worth the time to explore...while you're




there, be sure to drop into Cyberlich's apartment at Beyond Cybertown




Colony, building #3, apart. #69.  Also, be sure to check out the various




links to the SoE homepage that Cybertown supports.  We think you'll




be {rGREATLY{w impressed.  We are!




~
0 multi multiclass~
Ack! Mud now supports players having more than one class.




Eg, a player may chose to be Mage/Conjuerer or Thief/Warrior.




WHO and SCORE now report the levels gained.  A ' - ' character means that




the specified class is not available, eg:




Mag:23 Cle: - Thi: - , etc.  This means that player can advance in Mage levels,




but not in Cleric or Thief.




Skills and spells become available when ANY class' level meets the minimum




level required to use it.  The max level of the player is not used.




When casting spells, like above, the maximum level of THE CLASS THAT HAS ACCESS




TO THAT SPELL is used.  This way a char who is Mag:2 and War:50 won't be able




to cast 50th level Mage spells.





Level gain is no longer automatic.  The GAIN command must now be used instead,




to advance in the specified class.  See 'HELP GAIN' for more details.




~
0 boards~
There are now a number of _main_ boards on the game:




INFO Board - 5 rooms west of Midgaard Temple, this is used to hold rules and




	     general information.  Only Immortals can write on this board.




IDEA Board - In Midgaard Temple, this is inteneded to be used by players to




	     leave ideas for the mud.





There is also a board for players to use, for personal messages, etc.  It is




located 4 rooms west, 2 rooms south of Midgaard Temple.




To use the boards, you must be in a room with one :)




Type: WRITE <header> to leave a message, with the specified header/title.




      WRITE to:<name> to leave a private message.




      READ <number> to read a message.




To find out what messages are on a board, simply look at it.




There are also several other boards in the game, for clan and race use, as




well as various other use.




~
0 bank~
The BANK command allows you to carry out financial transactions with the bank 




of your choice.  All banks in the game respect a player's balance, meaning




you can use any bank you find.  




Usage: BANK [ balance | deposit | withdraw ]




BANK                 with no argument displays usage information.




BANK BALANCE         reports your current bank balance.




BANK DEPOSIT  <gold> deposits a specified amount of gold into your account.




BANK WITHDRAW <gold> withdraws a specified amount of gold.




Needless to say, you must have the specified amount of gold in your account or




inventory before you can deposit or withdraw it.




The banking system has been introduced as a measure to work alongside the new




limit on the amount of gold that a player can carry.  Eg:  How many people can




explore and fight, whilst carrying thousands of gold coins?




~
0 note mail~
Intermud Mail System!!!!




The main command is {GNOTE{x..all commands listed are preceded by it




{YTo Write:{x




to (name) - sets who note is going to




subject   - lets you write a subject

{gExamples!!!!{x




If you were writing a letter to {RCyberlich{x this is how you would do it




note to cyberlich




note subject hi




note write (or edit) -then write message, exit editor




note post




Cyberlich would then type




note list




note read # of message




note remove # of message to delete it




{RALL note and mail commands must be done at a postmaster!!{x




~
1 crusade crusades~
Crusades are auto quests that random mobs, depending on the average level of




the players logged on at the time. You must find the mob that stole the item,




get the item, and return it to the mob that wants it back.




Some questions you can ask on the crusade channel:




where are you?




where is the thief?




~
1 zmud client~
For those of you that haven't already, we recommend downloading a mud client




from the Internet.  {BShades {dof {REvil{x recommends zmud, which can be




found at http://www.rt66.com/ zugg/zmud.html . For those of you that already




have zmud--here is a tip from Zugg himself :) Zmud sets the default color




scheme to bright, which unfortunatly swapps our colours around.  Reset the




color scheme in zmud to dim, and they will appear as we want them.




~
0 dirt~
DIRT is a combat skill.  The player will attempt to kick dirt into the target's




eyes, causing (very) temporary blindness, which affects the target's combat




abilities.




~
0 chwere~
CWHERE tells you the location of any fellow clan members, where ever they are




in the game.  You must belong to a clan to use this command.




~
0 adapt~
ADAPT allows you to have a weapon adapted for your use, if it's level is higher




than yours.  Adapt can only be used when in the room with a NPC that offers




his/her services for adapting.  Typing ADAPT with no argument reports the cost




of having a weapon adapted.




Once the weapon has been adapted, it's damage will have been lowered in line




with the decrease in the weapon's level to your's.  Any affects on the weapon




(Eg affects HITROLL) will be heavily reduced, and probably cancelled.




If, once a weapon has been adapted, it's attributes indicate it will cause NO




damage, it will crumble into dust, and you will lose it.  




~
0 heal~
HEAL reports which spells you are able to buy, along with the cost.  This can




only be done if with a NPC which offers spells - usually healers.




HEAL followed by a single character 'buys' that spell.




Eg: HEAL H  buys a heal spell.




All spells are only cast on the buyer.  No one else.




~
0 gain~
GAIN increases one of your levels.  Level gain is no longer automatic, due




to the 'semi' multiclass system.  Typing GAIN with no argument will report




which levels you are able to gain in, and the cost to do so (in xp).




Typing GAIN with the 3-letter abreviation for a class will advance your level




in the given class, if you can level in it, and if you have enough xp.




Eg: GAIN thi    will advance your thief level, if you are able to level thief.




See also:MULTI WORTH TRAIN




~
0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'>




TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your




character has slightly random attributes.  The maximum value for each




attribute depends on your race and class.




It costs four practice to train an attribute, except that it costs




only three practice to train your prime attribute.




The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more




practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.




In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train




WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.




Train now reports the cost in practice points to increase an attribute.




It is also possible to spend practices on hit points or mana points.




~
0 PRAY~
Syntax: pray     <message>




Pray sends a message to *ALL* immortals on the game, even if they are wizinvis.




Eg: PRAY i'm stuck in a no-exit, no recall room - help!




WARNING: Un-necessary use of this channel will result in your ability to use




	 it being removed!




~
-1 RLIST~
RLIST reports details about the different races in these Realms.




~
0 SCAN~
SCAN reports the (seen) characters or mobiles surrounding the player.




Scan tells you the direction and the people situation that way, if any.




Useful for checking about you in unknown circumstances.




~
0 AUCTION GOSSIP . NEWBIE QUESTION ANSWER SHOUT YELL FLAME ZZZ MUSIC~
Syntax: auction  <message>      Syntax: gossip   <message>




Syntax: newbie   <message>      Syntax: question <message>




Syntax: answer   <message>      Syntax: shout    <message>




Syntax: yell     <message>      Syntax: zzz      <message>




Syntax: flame    <message>      Syntax: race     <message>




Syntax: clan     <message>      syntax: music    <message>




These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.




SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive




shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.




MUSIC, AUCTION, GOSSIP, NEWBIE, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages 




to all interested players.  '.' is a synonym for GOSSIP.  The QUESTION and 




ANSWER commands both use the same 'question' channel




FLAME is similar to auction, gossip, etc, but is intended for moaning about




life, players, etc.  ZZZ may only be used when sleeping.




YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.




RACE sends a message to members of your own race.  CLAN sends a message to




those in your clan.




You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.





~
0 bad breath~
Bad breath is an offensive spell, causing slightly more damage than the





'magic missile' spell.




~
0 influx~
When successfully cast, this will heal all players in the room.




~
0 warcry~
WARCRY is a Warrior-only spell, which acts the same as the 'bless' spell.




~
0 pemote~
PEMOTE acts in the same way as emote, except that where emote adds your name




before the argument, PEMOTE adds you name PLUS the characters 's




Eg PEMOTE feeling rather annoyed with Immortals         would be shown as:




Stephen's feeling rather annoyed with Immortals.




~
0 alias~
The ALIAS command allows you configure the six alias 'slots'.  An alias




takes the form of a name, and the alias.  To set up a new alias, type:




ALIAS <slot_number> <name> <alias>		For example:




ALIAS 2 ban emote turns into a banana and splits...




Now, whenever you type 'ban' the mud checks through the command table.  If




your input wasn't found, it then checks your alias.  Upon matching 'ban'




it issues the alias to the interpreter function, along with any argument




you typed after the alias name.  For example, you can define an alias:




ALIAS 1 ff cast 'faerie fire'   and then use it on mobs by typing:




ff <target_name>.  So typing 'ff stephen' will cause the mud to interpret




cast faerie fire stephen.




To show what aliases are set, type ALIAS with no arguements.




To clear an alias, type 'ALIAS <number> clear'.




~
0 colour color~
Firstly, please note the spelling: coloUr.  This is an English mud, so we




use English spellings :)




The mud now supports "ansi" colour.  Use the config command to turn on




or off this option.  The COLOUR command allows you to set uo what colours




you see different things in.  Please note:  The list of things you can




configure WILL be expanding!




To find out what colours are available, type 'COLOUR HELP'.




~
0 worth~
WORTH simply displays a list of any classes you are able to level in,




along with the cost in exp to gain in it, and the difference between that




cost and your current exp.




~
0 tongue~
TONGUE is equivalent to SAY, except that only players of your race will




understand what you say.  Anyone else will see gibberish!  Note that the




RACE command will tell to ALL members of your race (who are on the channel)




even if they aren't in the same room as you.




~
82 halls~
HALLS is a command which will transfer you, the immortal to the Entry Point,




situated within the Halls of the Immortals.  It is similar to recall, except




that there are no limitations on use if fighting, etc.  




~
0 guild~
GUILD is similar to RECALL in use, except that it transfers you (if possible)




to your Guild room, in the Player's Rooms, west of the Temple.  They provide




an easy way to gain entrance to a Guild Room.  If fighting, the same penalties




stand as for recall.




~
0 donate~
DONATE allows you to transfer a piece of equipment in your inventory




to the "Donation Room", situated close to your race's Temple.




~
0 diagnose~
DIAGNOSE allows you to check on the condition of a player or mob.




The condition is shown on a scale 5(best) to 1(worst) 




~
0 law wanted lawless~
{BShades {dof {REvil{x system of laws and punishments:




  Within the game, the major cities of the realm have a system of enforcing




rules of player behavior, by having certain players known to the realm as




being WANTED.  The system is simple, once you understand it's perspective.





  The civilized states of the realm enforce peaceful interaction between




citizens of the various states.  Killing and stealing from other citizens is




considered unlawful, and anyone that falls under the protection of the Law is




protected by these actions.





  There are three states that a citizen can have: Civilized, Wanted, and




Lawless.  Citizens that are Civilized are protected within the legal system




from being attacked by other citizens, and also from having things stolen from




them. If a Civilized citizen is attacked or stolen from, the Law will label




the attacker with Wanted, and deal with them accordingly.  In addition, if a




Civilized citizen breaks the Laws of the Realm, they also will be Wanted.





  Wanted citizens are no longer protected under the Law, and Civilized




citizens are authorized to kill or steal from them.  In addition, non-player




characters will interact with them violently.





  If you wish to become Lawless, this will your protection under the Law.




However, both actors in an interaction must be Lawless for the Law to ignore




their actions between each other.  If a Lawless attacks someone Civilized, the




Law will seek retribution on the Lawless.  If a Civilized citizen attacks a




Lawless, the Law doesn't protect the Lawless, it punishes the Civilized by




making them Wanted.  To become a Lawless, you may request a PKOK flag from an




Immortal.  Once you have chosen to be Lawless, the Law will never again place




you under its protection.





  Many hidden and unknown events in the game may take the protection of the




Law away from you, either permanently, or temporarily.  Some of these are




obvious, some not so obvious. A few of these events may even make you Persecuted,




which has several unforseen circumstances.





  When you become WANTED, either from breaking a law or other actions, you are




given a sentence based on your crime.  Sentences may only be reduced by




sacrificing valuable objects to the Law, by using the command sacrifice




<object> judge.  The judge will examine your sacrifice, and reduce your




sentence appropriately.





  The Law is omnicient in some ways, and becoming Wanted or Lawless may have




some unforseen repercussions, so consider your actions well before commiting




to them!





~
0 imm immortal immortals~
Due to some past events where common sense was overlooked




it was brought to the attentions of the immortals that there is a




problem in mortal/immortal relations.




The way the immortal team is run here is very leniant and laid back, much




less strict then those upon other Multi-User Domains. The point that




is trying to be made is simply to respect those who do rule upon the realms.




This has not been a wide spread problem but one that needed to be




addressed. Those immortals who you are aware that multi-play with mort




characters as well, remember that they are seperate entities in the realms.




All characters deserve respect....wether they be friend or foe.




Remember that anyone being rude or distasteful to not only immortals




but ALSO other morts will be dealt with accordingly.




~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  The amount of exp




you need to gain a level is determined by your race.  To gain a level, use




the GAIN command.




You gain experience by:




    Being part of a group that kills a monster,




    or by killing monsters on your own.




You lose experience by:




    Fleeing from combat




    Recalling out of combat




    Being the target of certain spells




    Dying




The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players




are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment




versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed




lately; and some random variation.




~
0 REMORT~
{CREMORT{W




Shades of Evil's remort policy is as follows:




        When you have attained 70th level in {Ytwo{W classes, you may add




        {Yone{W of the five remort classes to your character.




        When you have attained 70th level in that new class, and have




        attained 80th level in {Yall{W five basic classes, you may add




        a {Ysecond{W remort class.





        When you have attained 80th level in all classes, including the




        two remort classes, you will become an {wAdept{W.




When you are ready to remort, type gain <first three letters of new class>.





Remort classes are:




        -{cKnight{W




        -{MSorcerer{W




        -{gNecromancer{W




        -{wMonk{W




        -{dAssassin{W




~
0 DEATH~
When your character dies, your corpse is magically transported to the 




Morgue of Moribound - an establishment which serves all the realms of this 




land.  You are given a new body to use, and placed in the lands of 




Moribound.




The only task you must complete is to get to your corpse is find your way to




the morgue - a task set as a rather sick joke by the morgue's management.





Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.




Following and groups are not affected by death.




You lose HALF of the experience points you have.




Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.




Only the player who died may take items from his/her/it's corpse.




~
0 NEWBIE~
As a new player to Shades of Evil, there are several things that you will 




need to know.  First off, it's important to understand that this is a  




multiclass mud...you are, right now, a member of 5 classes.  When it comes




time to level your character, you can find the guildmasters in the players




area, west of the temple/recall.  Type help GAIN to find out about 




leveling your character.





Here are some important helps that you need to read:




	HELP COLOUR




	COLOUR HELP




	HELP DEATH




	HELP TRAIN




	WORTH





Here's a couple more things about Shades of Evil that are handy to know:




	Recalls are free, just type "recall"




	There is no rent here, just "save" and "quit"




	There are NO DEATHTRAPS on SoE...we hate them.




	There ARE item level limits...it's the only way we have right now




	  to control item flow among characters.




	Your colors are completely configurable, read COLOUR HELP.




	-and, last by not least-




	The Immortals are here to help you!  Ask them questions! (Politely!)

~
0 VAMPIRE~
{dVampires, creatures of legend?  Perhaps....perhaps not.




Centuries ago, there were four creatures that decended upon the world.




These creatures were called Methuselahs.  Their evil was spread to




others of the world, by shear force of will, leaving those newly 




initiated "Nosferatu" without a clue as to their new nature...what they




were, how they became that way, why they lust...




For generations, the will of the Methuselah was obeyed to the letter,




until they disappeared from the world, taking the children that they




initiated, and those children's children, with them.  Nothing was




left for the Nosferatu to study from, no information, no divine "truth".




Centuries later, it is believed that the Methuselah have returned,




spreading their evil anew.  Reports have been told worldwide of a Chapel




where their evil is felt...the wind in the spires of the Chapel whispers




the word "m e t h u s e l a h".




Legend has it that the spirits of the original Methuselah haunt




the halls of this Chapel, waiting to take control of mortal (immortal?)




bodies, and walk the world once again....{w

*******************************************************************




**** THESE ARE A BASIC, RUSHED-OFF SET OF RULES FOR IMMORTALS  ****




**** YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND AND ABIDE BY THEM!!!!  ****




*******************************************************************





Below follows a simple list of what you should and SHOULDN'T be doing,




whilst you are playing as an Immortal on SoE. Some muds have suffered




negative publicity via newsgroups. this is NOT something we wish to see




happening here :)




DON'T:




------




a) KILL PLAYERS - there are many ways, ALL of which are logged.  




b) HARRASS PLAYERS - by:




			  i) Changing their title with MSET 




			 ii) Changing sex/class/etc 




			iii) ATTACKING with SWITCH or FORCE 




			 iv) Changing mobs that are fighting players.




			  v) Misuse of channels.. emote/say/gossip/ etc




c) Misuse OLOAD and MLOAD to give players an unfair advantage in terms




   of equipment, or exp (from killing mobiles).




d) Misuse MSET and OSET to change the values on an item (to enhance eq)




   or to make high level mobs easy kills (to enhance exp).  Changing the stats




   on a Player shouldn't be done, either.




Basically, try to avoid doing stuff that players might not like at all.




Of course, misunderstandings will arise, but matters will be helped if




you haven't done anything to them, are polite, and don't simply fly off




the handle and freeze them.  FREEZE should only be used in really extreme




circumstances, not just as a way of expressing your anger.




(BTW, nearly all commands that could be used in ways 




 that would be considered violating these rules ARE logged.)




DO:




---




a) Be HELPFUL to players whenever possible.  If you're just sitting around




   talking to a friend, then you're not too busy to help a player.




   (Building *is* considered a good reason not to be helpful, but it would




    be nice if you could inform the player, instead of ignoring them.)




b) Be NEUTRAL - i.e. try not to play an evil or ultra-good char.  Players,




   especially newbies, will be more likely to stay if immortals are FAIR.




   For example, roleplaying Satan when an immortal would not be a Good Thing.




There are probably many, many more things that should be kept in mind. 





Remember that holding Immortal status on SoE is *NOT* your given right.




This may sound very heavy-handed, but remember these rules are meant more as




suggestions rather than rules.  If multiple complaints are made against




an immortal, the rules WILL be used, however.





Ultimately, the purpose of having a set of rules is to ensure ALL players




here get treated fairly, and equally.  Immortal giving hand-outs to their




buddies, and acting like idiots does nothing but damage the Mud and lose




unhappy players.





ALSO:




-----





Sadly, it seems that extra "rules" are required.  As above, these are 




really guidelines, but could possibly be used against you more forcefully




if there is cause for complaint.




i) [Added to "Don't: Harrass Players] Harrassing players includes being




downright unhelpful, or patronising.  If someone complains about something,




try to *HELP* them.  Don't simply say "Well, you're wrong".  Be _nice_ !




ii) On a similar theme, if someone complains about an area (especially one




you have built) then try to understand their position.  Yeah, it's easy to




tell them to "just go somewhere else and kill stuff" as an Immortal.  Think




how YOU would like it if that's how you were treated when playing your




mortal character.




iii) "Misuse of channels" INCLUDES the echo command.  Don't get nasty with




players over echo.  Just poke fun instead. :)  Again, put yourself in THEIR




place, and take a moment to think how you would like it.

This is a help file on clans; what they are, what they do, and how they do




it :)





First, Clans are groups of characters who help each other out on Shades of




Evil.  Undoubtedly, there will be some clan rivalry, but, hopefully, this




will not become too extreme :)  For you, the player, to join a clan, you




need to get ahold of the clan leader of the clan you want to join...he




or she can accept you into the clan -- if they decide you belong in the 




fold.







Clan commands:





	{YCWHERE	CDONATE	HOME	CLAN	LEAVE{w





Clan Job commands ( Armourer, Diplomat, Leader, Treasurer, and Boss):





	{YACCEPT	BANISH	MAKE	CTOGGLE	NEGOTIATE{w	





See the help files on the above commands for more info.

This is a help page for Clan Leaders devloping new equipment for their clan.




If you are not involved with this process, then there's not much here to




interest you.





If you are developing Clan Equipment, please note that you _must_ follow




these guidelines, if you wish your equipment to be considered legal.  You




will NOT be allowed to load any illegal equipment using the 'MAKE' command.





Each Clan may have 4 Pieces of equipment.  Each must be of different wear




locations.  You may not make staffs, wands, pills, scrolls, etc.  The only




equipment you can make are weapons, containers, or armor.





You have 'points' that you may distribute among the objects you make.




For 2 of the objects, you will have 20 points.  For the other 2, you will 10





Points are used to 'buy' stats on the object as follows:





 +--------++------+------+------+------+------+------+------+





 | Points || Mana | Move |  HPs |  DAM |  HIT |  -AC | Stat |

So, to 'buy' An -20 AC affect would cost 12 points.  It doesn't mean you




get ALL the entries for a given price!





Limitation:   You can only have a maximum of 3 different affects on each




              object.






If you think your objects are legal, contact Stephen, who will check them.




If he agrees they are valid, they will be added to your clan equipment, and




leaders of your clan will be able to load them for their members.
