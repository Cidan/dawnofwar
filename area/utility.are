BUILD HELP : SHOPS

------------------


Shops are basically mobiles with a few extras.  To make a shop, simply create

a mobile, and set the 'shopspec' part of the mobile.


trade0 - trade4 are the item types that the monile will buy or sell.

If you don't want 5 different item types bought/sold, leave some entries blank.


profbuy is the profit the shopkeeper makes when you buy an item.  100 = 100% =

no profit.  150 = 150% = a fifty percent increae in price.


profsell is the loss you make when selling.  100 = 100% = no loss.  50 = 50% =

you only get half the item's price from the shopkeeper.


profbuy should be no smaller than 100

profsell should be no larger than 100


openhour is the time the shop is 'open'

closehour is the time the shop is 'shut'


For a 24-hr shop, set openhour to 0 and closehour to 23.

BUILD HELP : DOORS

------------------


Uh-oh.  I don't know exactly _how_ doors are handled by the builder.  I'm

still working this one out myself.  As far as i know, this method seems to

work:


set the door as type door, and as closed, locked or pickproof, as needed.

Add a reset to close/lock the door.


Make sure you set both sides of the door.

~
-1 build_strings~
BUILD HELP : STRINGS

--------------------


STRINGS are collections of characters: i.e. words or sentences.

The most visible parts of an area are the descriptions on mobiles, objects, 

and especially rooms.  Please try and bear some thought to how these will

look, especially for mobiles and objects that may end up out of their intended

positions.  Room descriptions should be neutral, and not too short, where

possible.

~
-1 build_flags~
BULD HELP : FLAGS

-----------------


Flags are used to represent many different values.  Becasue of the way they are

implemented, this means a saving in space.  One integer can store MANY different

flags.  For the use of ther builder, a flag is a certain type of attribute, 

that can be either on or off; true or flase; yes or no.

For example, rooms use flags to store such information as 'dark', 'no_recall',

'indoors' etc.  When a new object, room or mobile is created, some flags will

be set my default.  In order to set it to be whatver you wish, you will need

to set the flags properly.

~
-1 build_building~
BUILD HELP : BUILDING

---------------------


BUILDING is a term used to refer to adding Rooms, Mobiles or Objects to the

mud, whilst still playing it, allowing possibly instant inclusion of the

rooms/mobs/objects into gameplay.


The builder allows to you to add new mobiles, rooms or objects.  It is up to

you how they look and act.  You have complete control over how your area looks.

Bear in mind that if you make objects that are too powerful, you may be asked

to tone them down in power.  If this does not happen, then an Immortal will

have to do it.... 


You should decide a level range for your area, and build your mobs ABOVE that

range.  It is usually wise to check with a Creator about the theme of your

area, AND the level range.

~
-1 build_resets~
BUILD HELP : RESETS

-------------------


Each area typically consists of Rooms, Objects and Mobiles.  Rooms 'appear'

almost automatically, but for your objects and mobiles to be loaded requires

the use of RESETS.  Using the builder, you can add resets to rooms, to do such

operations as loading mobiles, equiping mobiles with objects, randomising

exits, etc.

~
-1 build_vnums~
BUILD HELP : VNUMS

------------------


"VNUMS" stands for "Virtual Numbers".  They are arbitary numbers used to identify either Rooms, Objects or Mobiles on the mud.  Each object, room and

mobile must have a unique vnum, for their type.  That is, you can't have two

mobiles with the same vnum, but you could have a mobile and an object using the

same vnum.  Think of each of the three "users" of vnums as being completely

sperate:  Mobile vnums have to be unique, but only for mobs.  Object vnums must

also be unique, but also only for objects.  Room vnums must be unique, but only

for rooms.  


Each area consists of: rooms, mobiles and objects, principally.  Each area has

a vnum range associated with it.  So, for example, the range is vnums 100 to 199

(Kiess area).  There are rooms with vnums 101 - 195, objects with vnums 

101 - 143, and mobiles with vnums 101 - 135.  It is normal to use consecutive

vnums starting at the lowest vnum, for all objects, rooms and mobiles in an area.  Please try to conform to this usage of vnums!

{rThe READ THIS DESCRIPTION room.{w~
{rBEFORE YOU RECALL, PLEASE READ THE REST OF THIS DESCRIPTION!!! {Y There

have been many changes to the mud.  You have been transferred to this room,

because your playerfile was last saved BEFORE these changes came into force.

The major change has been in the skills and spells.  There is no longer such

an overlap between classes.  Now, each class ONLY gets skills or spells the

they "should" have.  Now, for some of you, this is not going to help much, i

know.  But, the old way skills/spells were organized, was from before we went

multiclass.  The change reflects the fact that classes should have specific

abilities.  There's not really much point in being a multiclass mud, if each

class has all the other's abilities. There are new spells and skills.  Many

old ones have been changed a LOT. Because of this, you will find that you are

no longer practiced in _any_ skill or spell. Before you totally panic, you

should also note that your number of practices has been increased in line with

the number of skills/spells lost.  There should also be a surplus, for you to

use as you like.

 In your inventory, you should also find a token, which will allow you to ask

an Immortal to set the order of your classes.  Instead of being race-based,

you now select the order of classes for your character, best -> worst.

 Another new feature is the 'SHELP' command, which gives help for spells.

(And soon, skills.)

Lots of other things about the mud have been changed or tweaked.  More detailed information

will (hopefully) made available.

Thanks for reading this.

This room serves no purpose at present.

This area is used to hold some mobs and objects for some new spells, and

a few other things.  I'll add something here soon.

There is a test exit going up to test the climb skill.

as the Orcs rampage through the land, slaying all humans they see.
